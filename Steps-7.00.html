These suggestions should be implemented to reduce the number of fatalities and accidents when it comes to air disasters.<br><br></div><div style="margin: 0px; color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;">1.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>In 2005, the Fatalities YoY% increase by&nbsp;<strong style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">13.09%</strong>, the Deceased per Month was at&nbsp;<strong style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">180.33</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;These numbers are important to understand the data because there were no proper regulations that were being applied to these well known aircraft carriers and manufacturers.&nbsp;<br>My suggestion is to invest in aviation maintenance and proper technology on board, as well as to&nbsp; invest in pilots training to enable them to make better decisions when such situations do arise.&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px; color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;">&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px; color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;">2.&nbsp; &nbsp; The Air Safety report indicates that the Piston Engines had the highest accidents per month with&nbsp;<strong style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">2.36</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>as its total, the turboprop had&nbsp;<strong style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">2.07,&nbsp;</strong>and Jet with<span style="color: rgb(17, 138, 15);">&nbsp;</span><strong style="color: rgb(17, 138, 15);">1.98</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>accidents per month records.&nbsp;<br><br>To mitigate the air disasters, there needs to be improvise designs and increase aviation technicians who are well versed in fixing Piston Engines that can be installed. Most of the&nbsp; aviations accidents caused by piston engines led to techincians not following the proper gidelines due to short staff of technicians on the team.&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px; color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;">&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px; color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;">3.&nbsp; &nbsp; Another suggestion from this analysis, the accident per year in 2002 (<strong style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">75</strong>) was the highest due to the Turboprop engine failures causing&nbsp;<strong style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">27&nbsp;</strong>Total Accidents per that year<strong>.</strong><br>This leads to suggesting&nbsp; for the need to&nbsp; apply more training requirements as yearly&nbsp; pilots training isnt enough. Another consideration to take into matter is most of the accidents occured with highest&nbsp; total fatalities in Taiwan and South Korea. The reason why there was a spike in the fatalities was because the pilots&nbsp; in both scenarios didn't get the enough rest that was&nbsp; needed before they could start their graveyard shift. A graveyard shift is when another pilot or cabin crew is on stand-by for another employee who is sick or can't make it to their shift. I suggest that cabin crew must get 12+ sleep before their next international flights.</div><div style="margin: 0px; color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;"><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1226/26/1.jpg" style="width: 50%;"></div><div style="margin: 0px; color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;"><br></div>
